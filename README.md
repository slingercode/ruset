# Ruset

## Use cases

- **Perform a clean install of the `node_modules` folder on a project:** The reason for this
  is that in a **private project** there are some changes on the Design System that we need to test
  locally and that temporal changes and some new changes sometimes break the folder and Vite is not
  loading the dependecies correctly.
  Is that workflow what we want?... absolutely not. Is optimal? ... nope, but, this kind of commands just makes my life a little bit more easier ðŸ¥¹

- **Install dependencies as `legacy`:** There are some old dependencies in the project that
  we need to handle, this is actually a WIP but there are another priorities and we are taking
  care of this issue in the free time... this is just an improvement for **one specific case**

- **WIP: remove yalc local changes:** This is related to the first point, but, this is another
  special use case, so it's not my priority

How I expect the command to work:

```sh
ruset path/to/dir (opts)
```

If no path provided search the `node_module` folder inside the current directory (this is going to be my goto almost all the time)

```sh
ruset (opts)
```

### TODO

- Improve the --help command
- Manage special use cases, this means that the execution of the command should work with the args specified
